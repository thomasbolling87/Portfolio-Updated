## Design Concepts
For my updated resume I wanted to do a simple and clean design with an easy color pallette.

My goal was to be able to present the best that I could do at this moment in terms of design.

Making sure that all the buttons to work and send to the correct locations/pages.

This design was pretty fun to do, and lets me see that I am improving.

I wanted to add some javascript, but I couldn't think of the best way to add js that made sense to me.
So I kept it to html and css. 

Please enjoy the photos that I have added to the readme page.
